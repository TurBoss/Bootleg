## Bootleg 041 - Guidelines for contributing

### How to help

There are multiple way to help in the development of Bootleg. Here are a few:

* Coding. Edit some parts of the code, enhance some functions, fix bugs, etc. You need to know Python 3.

* Small tasks. Small tasks include but are not limited to copying lines from a file in another, fixing typos and the like. Doesn't require any coding skill.

* Bug-hunting. Run Bootleg in many possible configurations with many possible choices to see if something fails and help to improve it.

* Translating. The longest, hardest and most tedious task of all (moreso than chunks of code). Translating is done through the [translate.py][0] file. To translate you need to add your language in the same way others are, check where each line appears (contact me if you don't know how to do this), add the constants (I can do those) and translate all the things. Bootleg has an extremely large amount of text involved, and translating everything can take from weeks to months to complete, even if doing this all day long. This is no small task. However, keep in mind it is fine to translate a bunch of lines and then stop for a while, or even let someone else handle it. That will make it an incomplete translation, though.

You may also translate the documentation files, found in the 'documentation' folder.
