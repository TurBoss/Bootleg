## To-Do List for Bootleg

### What is done

* File architecture
* Config file
* Parsable settings easy modification
* Most functions are done
* Preset file parsing
* Git integration, automatic updates
* Creating of a clone instance if it wasn't (first-time setup)
* Full translatability in any language

### What is left to do

* Main function
* Some functions and the parser for each parameter
* Game loader in python instead of batch
* Much more that I can't remember right now
